Migrated your system with openEuler? We invite you to share your experience as best practices or migration cases with the openEuler Migration Center. The contribution process is as follows:

   1.&nbsp;Publish your migration best practices or porting guides in our blog pages (see [Guidance to Post a Blog](https://www.openeuler.org/en/interaction/post-blog/)). Be sure to include keywords in your title, like "migration best practice" or "porting guide" for better visibility.

   2.&nbsp;If your blog is selected as a best practice or porting guide, the Compatibility SIG responds with "/lgtm".

   3.&nbsp;Once approved, the openDesign SIG publishes the blog in the Migration Center.
