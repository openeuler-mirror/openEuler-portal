Amidst the bustling atmosphere of the openEuler booth, where technical dialogues flourished and collaborations ignited, several key partners showcased their innovative contributions, further enriching the exchange of ideas and expertise. Let's delve into the remarkable presentations and contributions from our esteemed partners:

[HopeRun Software](https://youtu.be/Lfq8yiQHh3I?si=hhufECOKyI8inoKp) captured attendees' interest with their demonstration of a distributed collaboration solution and computing project. This demonstration highlighted the effective scheduling of diverse computing tasks across platforms, utilizing mathematical expressions and seamlessly integrating features from both openEuler and OpenHarmony systems, resulting in synchronized computing outcomes.

[ISCAS](https://youtu.be/BO_QAvx6f7w?si=SeApmSvgsmkhWeC5) shared updates on the openEuler RISC-V version, including an upcoming long-term release and the recent development of a laptop. These insights showcased the rapid evolution of the RISC-V ecosystem and advancements in software adaptation. Additionally, ISCAS presented

[AO.space](https://youtu.be/BO_QAvx6f7w?si=SeApmSvgsmkhWeC5), an innovative project contributed to openEuler last year.

[Linaro](https://youtu.be/qoO86Xzcz90?si=rZ7HyacwpE6dhKS6) provided strategies for optimizing Arm multicore capabilities and hardware accelerators in big data scenarios. The company's representative, Xu Guodong, emphasized key Arm platform features, including multicore processing and hardware accelerator integration.

[KylinSoft](https://youtu.be/TcZyVPX23OI?si=EDs8wG6nRYAyZqJO) exhibited NestOS, a cloud-based operating system built on openEuler. NestOS integrates rpm-ostree support and ignition configuration, featuring a dual-root file system and atomic update design. Tailored for platforms like K8s and OpenStack, NestOS minimizes container runtime overhead, enabling convenient cluster component capabilities and secure operations of large-scale containerized workloads.

As an early adopter of the openEuler community, the [EasyStack Cloud Platform (ECP)](https://easystack.io/product/29.html) is deeply rooted in the openEuler ecosystem. Adrian, Director of International Business Expansion at EasyStack, shared insights with attendees on the platform's architecture, featuring a platform-service decoupled design. Equipped with a lightweight digital native engine EOS and combined with diverse cloud services, the EasyStack cloud platform seamlessly caters to private deployment needs, from small to ultra-large scale. It flexibly addresses various computing requirements, spanning virtualization, bare metal computing power, cloud-native, and AI computing needs, making it suitable for AI and video data processing applications, and delivering robust cloud infrastructure solutions to customers.

## Conclusion

openEuler has always adhered to the "upstream first" strategy, deeply integrating into the global ecosystems. A survey conducted at the FOSSASIA Summit showed that over 70% of attendees had heard of openEuler, and nearly half of them were willing to try it out. This indicates that openEuler's visibility and influence in the open source field continue to grow, garnering widespread recognition and support.

FOSSASIA founders, Hong Phuc Dang and Mario Behling, highly praised openEuler's achievements in internationalization over the past two years in an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fO2QRYQSyUQ) with the openEuler team, and wished the openEuler community a prosperous future.

Under the spotlight of FOSSASIA Summit 2024, openEuler, together with its partners, has made significant contributions to the development of open source technologies. In the future, openEuler will continue to uphold the spirit of open source, exploring endless possibilities for technological innovation with developers worldwide.
