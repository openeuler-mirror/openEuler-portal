## Community Governance

### openEuler Technical Committee**'**s monthly meeting is held
To better support AI infrastructure development, openEuler Technical Committee renamed AI SIG to AI-Infra SIG, with a shift in the group's focus on:

- Adapting to (machine learning and deep learning) software stacks and providing out-of-the-box AI capabilities.
- Accelerating general-purpose/heterogeneous computing AI stack, such as AI hardware access framework, heterogeneous convergence, computing power allocation, XPU virtualization, and acceleration framework.
- Integrating AI with cloud native to build AI training and inference infrastructure solutions.

### openEuler adds Branch Keepers for repositories
Among SIG roles in openEuler, Committers take care of the code quality of a single repository in SIGs, wielding authority over code review and merge permissions. According to feedback from SIG members, there are too many Committers in some large repositories, leading to overlapping permissions and inconsistencies in code merge and branch management requests.

Addressing this concern, discussions among Infrastructure and relevant SIG members have yielded a proposed solution: the introduction of Branch Keepers. This new role aims to cooperate with Committers and Maintainers in branch management.
