MetaGPT serves as a multi-agent framework utilizing standard operating procedures (SOPs) to coordinate multi-agent systems based on LLMs, enabling meta-programming capabilities.
Key features:
  - Stable solutions: SOPs allows for generating more consistent and accurate solutions.
  - Diverse role assignment: Different roles are assigned to LLMs, ensuring comprehensive problem-solving capabilities. MetaGPT simulates a virtual software team with roles like product manager, architect, project manager, engineer, and quality engineer, integrating SOPs into the development process.
  - Enhanced AI agent capabilities: Using meta-programming technology, MetaGPT continuously enhances AI agent capabilities to better understand and execute complex tasks.

### openEuler Embedded makes significant progress in June
In June, openEuler Embedded achieved a major milestone with the release of the 24.03 LTS version. Concurrently, in collaboration with Hoperun, a validation demo was conducted for hybrid deployment of openEuler Embedded and OpenHarmony on the same hardware for different scenarios.

Validation on [Raspberry Pi 4 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/): One processor core allocated to openEuler Embedded for system management, two processor cores along with resources such as GPU, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth, allocated to OpenHarmony for human-machine interaction, and one processor core plus GPIO peripheral allocated to real-time operating system for simulated real-time control. Validation scenarios also included openEuler Embedded (2 cores) + 1 SMP RTOS (2 cores) and openEuler Embedded (2 cores) + 2 RTOS (1 core for each).

In terms of device-cloud collaboration, openEuler Embedded supports the combination of [KubeEdge](https://kubeedge.io/) and [iSulad](https://gitee.com/openeuler/iSulad), facilitating communications and container deployment between openEuler Server running Kubernetes management nodes and openEuler Embedded running KubeEdge + iSulad on the [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/) simulation platform. 

### EventedPLEG is added to iSulad, boosting stability performance by 30%
Developed to meet diverse needs in the CT and IT sectors, openEuler's iSulad container engine is known for its lightweight and high-performance capabilities, ideal for running in resource-constrained environments.

Based on Sandbox API in openEuler 24.03 LTS, iSulad now supports the standard container runtime interface (CRI) v1.29 and EventedPLEG. This upgrade to CRI v1 incorporates the latest upstream features into iSulad, resulting in an approximately 30% performance enhancement in stable conditions.
