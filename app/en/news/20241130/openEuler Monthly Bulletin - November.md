## **Community Governance**

### **Summary of the openEuler Technical Committee meetings in November**

* **Monthly meeting**

At the November openEuler Technical Committee meeting, the committee members approved the creation of the [openEuler Long SIG](https://www.openeuler.org/en/sig/sig-Long).

The Long SIG focuses on building a heterogeneous converged computing infrastructure, enabling unified access to diverse computing power, heterogeneous converged memory and virtualization, compute allocation, resource prioritization, and flexible migration. The SIG is responsible for maintaining relevant software components within the openEuler community, with the goal of reducing costs, improving efficiency, and enhancing the overall openEuler software ecosystem. In line with this mission, we warmly welcome developers and contributors who are interested in exploring related technologies to join the Long SIG.

* **2023–2024 annual meeting**

On November 16, the openEuler Technical Committee 2023–2024 meeting was held in Beijing. During the meeting, committee members presented their reports on community work for 2024, discussed strategies for optimization, and shared plans and directions for future development.

## **Technical Progress**

### **openEuler DevStation launched for developers**

As openEuler's first workstation tailored to developers, [DevStation](https://repo.openeuler.org/openEuler-24.09/DevStation/) is pre-installed with [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to enhance efficiency across the development workflow. By the end of 2024, oeDeploy is expected to be released on DevStation, which will support full-process automation from deployment and coding to compilation, build, and release. With oeDeploy, developers can easily deploy AI and cloud-native software stacks, pull code repositories using oeDevPlugin, compile with [AI4C](https://gitee.com/openeuler/AI4C/blob/master/README.en.md), and invoke [EulerMaker](https://eulermaker.compass-ci.openeuler.openatom.cn/), all of which simplify the software development process and enhance both efficiency and convenience.

### **openEuler introduces the PR review feature**

The openEuler community has launched an AI-powered PR review feature to enhance code quality and reduce the review workload for maintainers and committers.

This feature, based on LLMs, can be activated via the [openEuler CI bot](https://gitee.com/openeuler-ci-bot) and includes the following key functions:

* Code intent extraction: By commenting the **/summary-message** command under a PR, developers can prompt the AI to automatically analyze the changes, extract the code's intent, identify potential issues, and provide optimization suggestions and a PR score for reference.
* Code review and smell detection: By commenting the **/pr-review** command under a PR, developers can prompt the AI to automatically detect code changes. Leveraging the LLM's code analysis capabilities, the AI suggests modifications for unreasonable changes, thereby providing developers with guidance to improve code quality.

### **LFS Server for large file storage**

[LFS Server](https://github.com/opensourceways/BigFiles) is an open source, high-performance large file storage solution developed by openEuler. It supports a variety of file types with a 5 GB file upload limit and no repository size restrictions, offering developers ample storage space. Based on the standard LFS protocol, LFS Server streamlines seamless identity verification, optimizing the file upload and download process to minimize workflow disruptions.

Built using Go, LFS Server is a lightweight and efficient access service that fully supports Git LFS standards. By utilizing object storage, it provides scalable and reliable large file management. With its vast storage capacity and rapid download speeds, LFS Server enables developers to focus on their projects without concerns about large files affecting their repositories.

### **openEuler 24.03 LTS SP1 incorporates openHiTLS**

The cryptographic library is a key component of operating system security, essential for ensuring system security and data integrity. The [openHiTLS](https://gitee.com/src-openeuler/openhitls/blob/master/README.en.md) open source SDK has been officially integrated into openEuler 24.03 LTS SP1. It features a lightweight, customizable architecture that meets the diverse needs of various industries. It supports diverse mainstream cryptographic algorithms and protocols, allowing users to select the most appropriate options for secure data transmission and storage.

### **openEuler Backup SIG progress**

The [openEuler Backup SIG](https://www.openeuler.org/en/sig/sig-Backup) has been actively working on improving the first community release of [open-eBackup](https://gitee.com/openeuler/open-eBackup/blob/master/README.en.md), an open source backup solution that provides E2E backup and recovery capabilities for mainstream database, virtualization, file system, big data, and more applications.

### **openEuler's official website and forum have been optimized for a better user experience**

To improve the developer experience, the openEuler community has rolled out a series of optimizations to its official website and forum:

[**Official website**](https://www.openeuler.org/en/):
