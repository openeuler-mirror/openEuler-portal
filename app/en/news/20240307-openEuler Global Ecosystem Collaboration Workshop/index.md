Dr. Xiong Wei, the Executive Director of the openEuler Community, articulated his vision for openEuler as a multifaceted computing platform that caters to a variety of scenarios. He elaborated on the symbiotic strategy of 'openEuler for AI' and 'AI for openEuler'. He underscored the transformative impact of AI on the interaction dynamics between individuals and the operating system. Furthermore, he emphasized how openEuler, as an operating system, is poised to expedite the AI training process, bolster reliability, and curtail costs.

Subsequently, Dr. Wayen Ren, a member of the openEuler Technical Committee, unveiled openEuler Embedded - a comprehensive and open-source embedded software platform. He delved into the architecture, salient features, and application scenarios of the platform. In addition, he particularly spotlighted the mixed-criticality framework, colloquially known as MICA, of openEuler Embedded. He accentuated the versatility of openEuler and its potential as a springboard for innovation.

Representatives from China Mobile, Intel, Linaro, Zephyr project of the Linux Foundation, Eclipse Foundation, and Igalia shared their organizations' contributions to major web development and OS-related open source development. They also discussed potential areas of collaboration with openEuler.

- Zhang Shengju (China Mobile) introduced the joint innovations of China Mobile and the openEuler community, including energy-aware scheduling based on software-hardware collaboration, virtualization monitoring, analysis platform, and hardening system security.
- Elton Yang (Intel) reviewed Intel's collaboration and participation with openEuler in open source over the past two years, recalling the long-term integration and support of openEuler for Intel in the upstream since 2022. He also called on industry partners to work together in creating an open accelerated computing framework and looked forward to working more closely with openEuler in the future.
- Andrea Gallo (Linaro) described how Linaro, the software engine for the Arm ecosystem, accelerates the development, testing, and deployment of Arm-based innovations through collaborative engineering, services, and solutions, and applies this model to its work with openEuler.
- Benjamin Cabé (Zephyr) provided an overview of Zephyr's positioning in the RTOS, and expressed his desire to work with openEuler.
- Gaël Blondelle (Eclipse Foundation) elaborated on the Eclipse Foundation's values, and expressed his willingness to further collaborate with openEuler.
- Andres Gomez (Igalia) tried to answer how we should think about the future of operating systems and how we can manage and deploy them, by addressing two major trends in the next generation of Linux distributions: immutability and repeatability.
