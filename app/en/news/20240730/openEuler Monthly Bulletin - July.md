### openEuler supports Security Advisory disclosure in CSAF

The Common Security Advisory Framework [(CSAF)](https://oasis-open.github.io/csaf-documentation), an official standard released by the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS), is used for disclosing security advisories in machine-readable formats. CSAF is primarily focused on providing solutions for vulnerabilities and includes five types of documents: CSAF Base, Security Incident Response, Informational Advisory, Security Advisory, and VEX, each suited for different vulnerability disclosure scenarios.

openEuler currently supports disclosures in the Security Advisory format and plans to gradually extend support to historical data and the VEX type. You can download the [CSAF files](https://repo.openeuler.org/security/data/csaf/advisories/) for openEuler now.

### openEuler community establishes signature system

Protecting the security and integrity is crucial for open source software components. openEuler has established a software release signature system based on Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). During the software building phase, digital signatures are automatically added to target files, and [public key certificates](https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/certificate-center/) are embedded in key components. This allows users to activate the signature verification mechanism directly after installing openEuler images, thereby enhancing system security.

### iSulad completes support for CDI

Container engines have become the cornerstone of the cloud-native era with the rapid development of container technology. How to enable containers to use devices like GPUs and NPUs more quickly and conveniently has become a key community focus. The [openEuler Cloud Native SIG](https://www.openeuler.org/en/sig/sig-detail/?name=sig-CloudNative) has implemented the Container Device Interface (CDI) specification in [iSulad v2.1.5](https://docs.openeuler.org/en/docs/24.03_LTS/docs/Container/iSulad_support_for_CDI.html), supporting CDI functionality through the CRI interface. This makes using devices simpler in both the runtime and Kubernetes, standardizes how containers load these devices.

### High-performance storage project FastBlock advances

In July, the [FastBlock](https://github.com/openeuler-mirror/fastblock/blob/master/README.en.md) project, initiated by Unicom Digital Tech and jointly maintained by the [SDS SIG](https://www.openeuler.org/en/sig/sig-detail/?name=sig-SDS), has achieved significant updates and optimizations.

FastBlock is a distributed block storage system designed for all-flash scenarios and addresses the urgent need for low-cost, high-performance block storage in database and virtualization scenarios. In the case of using only standard NVMe media, the latency performance of a three-replica, single-client configuration with iodepth=1 is over five times better than Ceph.

The FastBlock team has completed the following updates and optimizations in July:

* SPDK upgrade: Upgraded SPDK to version 24.05, adapting to API changes and performing regression testing. Added FastBlock bdev-related RPCs to the SPDK source code.
* Performance optimization: With multi-core optimization and uniform distribution of PGs across cores, drivers can nearly reach their maximum performance capacity. Under the same conditions, the cluster's 4K random write performance improved from 170,000 IOPS in June to 420,000 IOPS.
* I/O latency optimization: Resolved latency issues caused by adding OSD ID to OSD logs, optimized RPC data transmission methods, and reduced serialization overhead.
* Issue fixes: Added UUID validity checks, optimized OSD port binding retry mechanisms, memory pool APIs, and CPU binding methods.
* Cluster stability enhancements: Added a cluster **fsid** field to prevent OSDs from different clusters, resolving the issue where OSD monitor clients would encounter bugs when parsing monitor information, leading to exceptions and causing cluster instability.

### UADK undergoes significant update

In July, the User Space Accelerator Development Kit (UADK), developed by [Linaro](https://www.linkedin.com/company/linaro/) and Huawei and maintained by the [AccLib SIG](https://www.openeuler.org/en/sig/sig-detail/?name=sig-AccLib), has achieved a significant update.

UADK provides a unified programming interface to efficiently utilize hardware accelerators and supports Shared Virtual Addressing (SVA) technology. It offers a growing set of high-performance algorithm implementations, including functions such as encryption and compression.

In the latest openEuler 24.03 LTS release, UADK supports both hardware acceleration engines, AArch64 SVE, and Crypto Extension CPU instructions.

The updated UADK supports the following acceleration algorithms:

* Compression algorithms: GZIP, ZLIB, DEFLATE, LZ77\_ZSTD
* Asymmetric cryptography: RSA, DH, ECC (SM2, ECDSA, ECDH, X25519/X448)
* Symmetric cryptography: AES, SM4, DES/3DES
* Digest algorithms: SHA-1, SHA-2, SM3, MD5

### Rust-Shyper hypervisor makes notable strides in development

The [Rust-Shyper](https://github.com/openeuler-mirror/rust_shyper) system, based on the Rust language, aims to deliver a highly reliable, embedded hypervisor. Recently, Rust-Shyper has undergone some new changes:

* Supports CPU virtualization for the RISC-V architecture, enabling multiple vCPUs to run on a single physical CPU, and has successfully simulated the interrupt controller PLIC.
* Supports both passthrough and emulated devices. The system can inject interrupts into virtual machines (VMs) via the simulated PLIC and has virtualized the supervisor binary interface (SBI) to provide a complete SBI environment on the hypervisor.
* Supports tailoring and modifying the device tree to present a unique device view to each VM.

### MICA framework advances efficient multi-OS hybrid deployment

In embedded scenarios, while Linux is widely used, it does not meet all needs, particularly in cases requiring high real-time performance, reliability, and security. To address these requirements, the openEuler Embedded team has introduced the mixed-criticality deployment framework ([MICA](https://www.openeuler.org/en/blog/20231226-MICA/MICA%20Facilitates%20Mixed-Criticality%20Deployments.html)). MICA enables efficient hybrid deployment of multiple operating systems, meeting the diverse functional, real-time, and power consumption needs of embedded systems. Through MICA, it is possible to integrate, manage, and coordinate multiple RTOS capabilities in a SoC.

### Big Data SIG progresses in July

In July, the [Big Data SIG](https://www.openeuler.org/en/sig/sig-detail/?name=bigdata) mainly focused on the following key areas:

* **Apache Bigtop's official support for openEuler**

On July 8, 2024, [Apache Bigtop](https://bigtop.apache.org/) 3.3.0 was released with support for the openEuler operating system. This milestone shows that openEuler has officially become part of Bigtop's big data ecosystem.

* **The development of bigtop-manager**

The [bigtop-manager project](https://github.com/openeuler-mirror/bigtop-manager), a cloud-native big data cluster management platform, has been developed to efficiently manage the big data components supported by Bigtop. The project, maintained and operated by the openEuler Big Data SIG, has now been incorporated into Apache Bigtop as a sub-project.

## Security Bulletin

In July 2024, the community published 136 security notices and patched 197 vulnerabilities (7 critical, 32 high, and 158 others).

The following vulnerabilities have a significant impact and require special attention:

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: the issue of key expiration being overwritten during instantiation. Previously, the expiration time of a key was unconditionally set to permanent upon instantiation, leading to problems with DNS resolution. This was because the expiration time set by user space was overwritten to TIME64\_MAX, effectively disabling further DNS updates. The issue has been fixed by restoring the condition that key\_set\_expiry is only called when the pre-parser specifies a particular expiration time. ([CVE-2024-36031](https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/cve/detail/?cveId=CVE-2024-36031&packageName=kernel)) – CVSS 9.8
Affected release:
openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP3
openEuler-24.03-LTS

adts\_decode\_extradata in libavformat/adtsenc.c in FFmpeg 4.4 does not check the init\_get\_bits return value, which is a necessary step because the second argument to init\_get\_bits can be crafted. ([CVE-2021-38171](https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/cve/detail/?cveId=CVE-2021-38171&packageName=ffmpeg)) – CVSS 9.8
Affected release:
openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP4
openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP1
openEuler-22.03-LTS-SP3
