## **Community Governance**

**The first openEuler Committee Meeting this year was held**

On February 21, 2025, the first openEuler Committee Meeting for 2025–2026 was held at the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences, in Beijing.

**Key outcomes:**

* Appointed Hu Xinwei as the Chairperson of the openEuler Committee and Maggie Liang as the Chairperson of the Marketing Committee.
* Reviewed and approved the 2025 annual plans of each sub-committee.
* Reviewed the community's five-year achievements in open source.

## **Key Technical Progress**

**openEuler is adapted to the STM32MP257 microprocessor**

Collaborated with [STMicroelectronics](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en.html) and [MYIR](https://www.myirtech.com/), openEuler has completed the hardware adaptation of the high-performance [STM32MP257](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32mp257.html) microprocessor with the MYD-LD-25x development board.

**Key features of STM32MP257:**

* Dual Cortex-A35 64-bit cores running at up to 1.5 GHz and Cortex-M33 cores running at 400 MHz
* 1.35 TOPS NPU and 3D GPU, supporting H.264 encoding/decoding

The openEuler community will further focus on enhancing the adaptation of ROS2 images, mixed-criticality system images, embedded graphics images, and embedded AI images, with plans to incorporate Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) support.

**Chatig, incubated in openEuler, is now available on public cloud**

The China Unicom Cloud's AI inference gateway service, [Chatig](https://gitee.com/openeuler/chatig), was incubated in the openEuler community in November 2024 and now available on public cloud.

**Key features:**

* Supports 13 models, including DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3.
* Provides multi-model switching, data privacy protection, content review, QoS traffic limiting, and user authentication.
* Offers services via a unified API, allowing users to access model capabilities on demand.

## **Hardware & Software Compatibility**

As of February 28, 2025, 19 products were certified compatible (11 applications from ISVs, 6 hardware components from IHVs, and 2 OSs from OSVs).

View more in the [compatibility list](https://www.openeuler.org/en/compatibility/).

## **Security Bulletin**

As of February 28, 2025:

* 149 security notices published
* 404 vulnerabilities patched (10 critical, 96 high, 298 others)

The following vulnerabilities have a significant impact and require special attention:
