[OSSummit EU 2024](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/archive/2024/open-source-summit-europe/), the premier global open source event, kicked off in Vienna, Austria, from September 16â€“19. This year marked OpenAtom openEuler's third consecutive year of participation, where openEuler not only delivered the keynote "[How openEuler Is Powering Tomorrow's AI Infrastructure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61b-v3hQC18)", but also hosted openEuler Mini Summit to dive deep into the latest trends in open source operating systems and AI, engaging developers from around the world.

## Linaro's presentation

As one of the most relevant and active partners of the openEuler community, [Linaro](https://www.linaro.org/) joined the openEuler Mini Summit, where Linaro's CTO Grant Likely delivered a talk titled "[The Story Behind Linaro & openEuler Collaboration](https://youtu.be/rAkEdQEBm3E)". He highlighted Linaro's role in promoting open source software to support the Arm ecosystem, and detailed how Linaro and openEuler's collaboration has enhanced the Arm ecosystem in recent years, and what lies ahead for future advancements.

## The collaboration between Linaro & openEuler

The collaboration between Linaro and openEuler is pivotal to facilitating the Arm architecture ecosystem, particularly within AArch64 data center applications. The core of this partnership is to provide a reliable operating system and comprehensive support for application vendors, making sure their software or workload can run well on Arm. Together, Linaro and openEuler have researched and integrated a series of key technologies into openEuler, pushing the boundaries of innovation.

For example, both teams have worked to strengthen software-defined storage (SDS), providing support for AArch64 platforms in upstream communities such as [Lustre](https://www.lustre.org/), [Ceph](https://ceph.io/en/), and [DAOS](https://daos.io/). This has optimized performance, improved availability, and bolstered openEuler's standing in these areas.

In the big data domain, Linaro and openEuler have collaborated on [Apache Bigtop](https://bigtop.apache.org/), [Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/), and other components, enabling upstream support for Arm HPC. We have also implemented native support for [Apache Bigtop 3.3.0 on openEuler](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BIGTOP-3875), with ongoing optimizations for more Bigtop components based on AArch64.

To further facilitate the Arm ecosystem, the two teams also jointly developed the [Linaro Ecosystem Dashboard (LED)](https://ecosystemdashboard.linaro.org/?_gl=1*x5caxw*_ga*OTA3NjQ5MTIzLjE2OTMxNzc4Nzk.*_ga_E12E6FXFVK*MTcyNzg3NzExNy4zMTkuMS4xNzI3ODc3MTI2LjAuMC4w), an exchange platform that helps developers worldwide find software compatible with Arm platforms.

Additionally, both communities have collaborated on Arm confidential computing based on Arm V9. We have co-developed the ARM64 CCA project and continued to deliver end-to-end solutions to enhance the security of Arm platforms.

## Future prospects

With openEuler's focus on diverse use cases, operating systems, and multiple architectures, the groundwork laid by this collaboration sets the stage for future advancements. Both Linaro and openEuler look forward to expanding the partnership, further driving innovation and growth of the Arm ecosystem.
