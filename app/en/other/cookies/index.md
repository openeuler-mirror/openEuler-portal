## 3. Do Not Track

Many browsers provide the "Do Not Track" feature, which sends the "Do Not Track" request to websites. So far, major Internet standardization organizations have not established policies to regulate how websites should respond to such requests.
The openEuler community does not change how data is collected and used as described in this statement based on the "Do Not Track" setting you have selected or other opt-out settings or features that your browser may provide. However, the openEuler community reserves the right to change the data processing mode without notifying you.
