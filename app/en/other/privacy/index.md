The OpenAtom Foundation (hereinafter referred to as "we", "us", or "foundation") understands the importance of your privacy and fully respects it. <u>**Please read this Privacy Statement ("Statement") carefully before you submit your personal data to us.**</u> If you have any questions about how we process your personal data, please feel free to contact us.

## 1. How We Collect and Process Your Personal Data

If you only browse the general content of the openEuler community website (hereinafter referred to as "this website"), we usually do not require you to provide personal data. However, we will collect your personal data in the following cases:

**(a) Account Service**.

  1. When you register for an openEuler community account, we will collect your user name, email address, mobile number, password, and email/phone verification code. A unique account identifier will be automatically generated. Refusal to provide this information will prevent account creation.
  2. When you log in to the openEuler community using your user name, email address, or mobile number, we will collect the provided credentials and verification code for authentication. Refusal to provide this information will prevent login.
  3. When you log in using a third-party account (Gitee, GitHub, or OpenAtom), we will collect your user name, user ID, nickname, avatar, and email address from that platform for authentication and code repository access management. If you use Gitee or GitHub without an existing bound openEuler account, a new openEuler account with a unique identifier will be automatically generated, deriving its user name from your Gitee or GitHub account. Refusal to provide this information will prevent login via third-party accounts.
  4. After logging in, you can optionally provide your avatar, nickname, and company name. This information is not required for using openEuler community features.
  5. After logging in, you can modify your email address, mobile number, and password.
  6. After logging in, you can bind your openEuler account to a third-party account (GitHub, Gitee, or OpenAtom). We will collect your user name, user ID, nickname, avatar, and email address from the bound platform. Refusal to provide this information will prevent third-party account binding for login purposes.

**(b) Forum Service**. The forum service provides you with the following functions. We will process the data required for providing the functions. If you do not provide the required data, your experience may be affected when you use the functions of the forum service.

Login and identity authentication: You can use an openEuler community account to log in to the forum service. We will use the user name, nickname, and email address of your openEuler community account to authenticate your identity and manage your data.

User center: After login, your openEuler community account user name will be displayed on the User Center page.
You can also set the nickname, profile picture, and signature used in this forum on the Account page. The nickname, profile picture, and signature will be stored and displayed on the User Center page.

Data publishing and interaction: The forum service provides you with data publishing and interaction services. Therefore, we will collect and process your published content, images, audios, videos, documents, comments, likes, favorites, and reports, and your nickname and profile picture will also be used and displayed.
To promote exchanges and interactions, we will collect statistics on and display your posts, likes, follows, and favorites on the User Center page. Your favorites are visible only to yourself by default, but you can set them to be visible to other users. To keep the preceding data up to date and display them to you, we will collect and use your data, including your posts, comments, likes, favorites, and follows.

Product operations and maintenance: To provide you with rich product experience, improve product operations policies, ensure stable product running, and ensure network security according to laws and regulations, we will collect your login account information, device hardware information, operating system settings, network information (such as IP addresses), network operator information, your browsing or touching records in this forum, and error messages.

**(c) Mail Subscription**. When you use our mail subscription service, we will collect your <u>**email address and name (optional)**</u>. We will provide you with the email subscription service through this email address to facilitate your participation in discussions in the community.

To ensure the openEuler community functions as best as possible, and to provide better services for you, we will collect information about your browser, computer, and mobile device, including **the access timestamp, IP address, request details, access status, size of accessed resources, access source, and request user agent information**. Based on this information, we will collect statistics to understand the operating status of the openEuler community. The web analytics tool provider captures data about your activities on our website through cookies and other technologies and provides this data to us anonymously. No website user can identify this information.

**(e) Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") Signing**. When you participate in code contribution through the Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") signing system (click [here](https://clasign.osinfra.cn/sign/gitee_openeuler-1611298811283968340) to learn more), you need to submit your [relevant personal data](https://clasign.osinfra.cn/privacy) to the CLA signing system. We will obtain such personal data to verify whether you have signed the CLA, and to conduct relevant statistical analysis to understand how the community is operating.

**(f) Talent Assessment**. After you pass the openEuler community talent assessment test, we will collect your name, email address, test partner, test score, and certification level from our test partners to generate the openEuler community talent certificate for you. In addition, we acquire such data to conduct relevant statistical analysis about talent development of the community.

**(g) Content Release**. When you participate in community meetings, live broadcasts, blogs, community activities, contribution in the open source community, or newsgroups, your user name and the information you publish will be visible to the community and the public. If you are a SIG member of the openEuler community, we will request your Gitee information for posting on our website.

**(h) Quick Issue Creation**. When you use the QuickIssue service of the openEuler community to submit an issue, you will need to provide an email address, and a verification email will be sent to the email address you provided to verify the validity of the email address. After an issue is created, some information about your email address will be displayed in the description area on the issue page and in the submitter information of the QuickIssue dashboard.

Furthermore, the community will request your name and company name for the purpose of meetup sign-ins, nameplates, and other related activities.

**(l) openEuler User Group application**. When you apply to participate in an openEuler User Group event, the community will collect your name, company, position, email address, phone number, and WeChat ID, which will be used to contact you and confirm your application and other related matters.

We may also supplement the personal data we collect from you with additional personal data we receive from third parties, including other platforms, communities, or legal and public channels within the scope of your authorization and consent. We promise to process your personal data in strict accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Please read the privacy statements and user agreements of the third parties carefully. If your personal data provided by a third party is required for using related services of the community, but you refuse to allow the third party to collect, use, transfer, or share your personal data when the third party provides services, you may not be able to use related services of the community. For example, when you use an authorized third-party account to log in to the community, we will obtain your personal data from the third party with your consent.

**(n) Compatibility Test Service**. When using the compatibility test service, you can log in with your openEuler community account. We will use the user name, nickname, email address, and mobile number of your openEuler community account to authenticate your identity and manage your data. When you edit your basic personal data on your profile page, we will collect your user name, mobile number, and email address. The user name and mobile number will be used to notify you of the identity authentication results, while the user name and email address will be used to update you on the certification progress. After an openEuler compatibility test is passed, the service will collect your project manager's name and signature through the certification confirmation page to generate a compatibility certificate for you.
