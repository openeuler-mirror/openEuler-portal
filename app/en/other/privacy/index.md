## 1. How We Collect and Process Your Personal Data

If you only browse the general content of the openEuler community website (hereinafter referred to as "this website"), we usually do not require you to provide personal data. However, we will collect your personal data in the following cases:

(a) Account Service. The openEuler community provides the openEuler community account service for unified identity and permission management. When you register an openEuler community account, we will collect your email address or mobile number for identity verification and your Gitee or GitHub account for permission management of the community code hosting platform. In community activities, we will use the preceding personal data to verify your identity in the community and collect statistics based on the data so that we can understand the operating status of the openEuler community platform.

(b) Forum Service. The forum service provides you with the following functions. We will process the data required for providing the functions. If you do not provide the required data, your experience may be affected when you use the functions of the forum service.

Login and identity authentication: You can use an openEuler community account to log in to the forum service. We will use the user name, nickname, and email address of your openEuler community account to authenticate your identity and manage your data.

User center: After login, your openEuler community account user name will be displayed on the User Center page.
You can also set the nickname, profile picture, and signature used in this forum on the Account page. The nickname, profile picture, and signature will be stored and displayed on the User Center page.

## 2. How We Use Cookies and Similar Technologies

(a) To ensure our website works properly, we may at times place cookies on your computer or mobile device. A cookie is a small data file placed on your computer or mobile device that facilitates your access to a website. The content of a cookie can be retrieved or read only by the server that creates the cookie. We use cookies and similar technologies for understanding how you interact with our websites, helping you efficiently browse pages, storing and honoring your preferences, improving your browsing experience, and fulfilling other legitimate purposes.

(b) We categorize cookies on our websites into two categories:

​ (1) Required cookies: When you use the websites, cookies improve your Web browsing experience.

​ (2) Statistical analysis cookies: We collect information about your use of our services, including your single or multiple visits, which help us understand how you interact with the services. We use the statistical analysis plugin provided by Baidu.

Many services require cookies. If you do not allow cookies related to these services, you may not be able to use these services or specific functions of these services.

(c) **Do Not Track**. Many Web browsers provide the **Do Not Track** function, which sends **Do Not Track** requests to websites. Currently, major Internet standardization organizations have not established policies to specify how websites should handle these requests. If you enable **Do Not Track** or similar functions that your browser may provide, we will not change the way your data is collected and used as described in this Statement. However, we reserve the right to respond to your **Do Not Track** request and stop collecting your data without prior notice.

(e) **Expiration Time**. We may use both session cookies, which expire when you close your browser, and permanent cookies, which are stored on your computer or mobile device for six months according to applicable laws and regulations or until you reject or delete them.

(f) **Other technologies**. In addition to cookies, other similar technologies may be used to automatically collect information. We may use browser web storage through HTML5, also called localStorage objects, to implement similar functions as cookies. Browser web storage can store more data than cookies. Your web browser may be able to clear the browser web storage.

## 3. How We Share Your Personal Data

Sharing means providing third parties with your personal data. The third parties and we would handle the personal data independently. We do not share your personal data with third parties without your consent, except in the following circumstances or as described in this Statement:

We may disclose your personal data to professional advisors, such as auditors, insurers, bankers, and lawyers, where necessary in the course of the professional services that they render to us.

​ (3) We integrate Baidu Statistics SDK from Beijing Baidu Netcom Science Technology Co., Ltd. to provide more complete and high-quality services and better support daily data analysis requirements of activity operations, user operations, and technology development. Baidu Statistics SDK needs to collect and use your necessary device information (IP address, OS, network service provider, system language, screen resolution, screen color, region, browser type, browser language, and browser version), usage information (access source, search keyword, accessed pages, pop-ups, visitor ID, number of community accesses, stay duration, access timestamp, and server type and version).

When we share your personal data with affiliates or partners, their responsibilities and obligations will be governed by contracts and we will require them to take appropriate measures to ensure the security of the personal data processed.

## 4. How Long We Retain Your Personal Data For

We will retain your personal data for no longer than is necessary for the purposes set out in this Statement, unless otherwise required by laws or requested by you.

Generally, we will store or retain your personal data within the retention period according to applicable laws or service agreements from the date when we obtain your personal data in the community. If your personal data has exceeded the retention period and no law requires us to continue processing your specific personal data, we will delete your personal data or anonymize it according to applicable laws and regulations.

For example, the IP address, access timestamp, access source, accessed pages, access status, accessed resource size, OS, system language, browser type, browser language, browser version, and server type and version information collected for service optimization will be automatically deleted after 10 days.

For example, when the community no longer displays you as a member of an openEuler User Group, we will delete your personal data (avatar, name, email address, company/school, position, personal profile) within one month.
