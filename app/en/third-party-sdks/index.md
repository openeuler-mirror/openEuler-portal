# Third-Party SDKs

<hr/>

To ensure the implementation of functions of the OpenAtom Foundation and the stable running of this website, we may incorporate software development kits (SDKs) provided by third parties. Different website versions may incorporate different third-party SDKs. We perform strict security checks on SDKs and similar programs and require our partners to take strict measures to protect your personal data. To meet new service requirements or accommodate service function changes, we may adjust our incorporation of third-party SDKs, and explicitly update you about the SDKs in this description in a timely manner. Please note that a third-party SDK may collect different data due to reasons such as version updates and policy adjustments. For the exact information, please refer to the official announcement of the SDK provider.
