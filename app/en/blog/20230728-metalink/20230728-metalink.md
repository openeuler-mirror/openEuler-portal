For developers in the openEuler community, it is necessary to download software from the openEuler repository. **Finding a way to quickly download software is a priority for the developers.**

To optimize user experience and accelerate the download speed, the metalink configuration item is added in the DNF configuration file of openEuler 22.03-LTS-SP2, with which software download from the openEuler repository can be accelerated by more than 20 times. **Users can directly download openEuler to use this function.**

# Download Examples

To verify the effect of this function, we performed download tests on clients in North America, Europe, and China. The test results are as follows:

After the metalink configuration item is added, **the download speed in China increases by 20 to 30 times, and that in Europe and North America increases by 50 to 100 times.**

# Future Plan

The metalink configuration item will be added to more releases of openEuler to ensure that users can download software more efficiently and stably.
