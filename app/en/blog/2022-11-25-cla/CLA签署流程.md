### A Guide to Signing the openEuler Corporation CLA

#### 1. Why Is a Corporation CLA Necessary for Joining the openEuler Community

A Contributor License Agreement (CLA) is usually required for a developer to contribute to an open source project. The CLA is the declaration of individual or corporation contributors as owning the copyright to the content that they contribute. By signing the CLA, the contributors allow their contributions to be redistributed under an open source license while reserving their copyright, and if the contributions include patents, grant a patent license within the scope of the project.

2.4 Scan the CLA with the official seal, signature, and date as a PDF file, and reply to the email received in step 2.2 with the PDF file attached to complete CLA signing.

2.4 There are two types of administrators in the CLA management system of corporation employees in the openEuler community: **super administrator** and **system administrator**. After receiving the email, the administrator of the openEuler system checks the PDF file. If the file pass the check, the email box used to sign the corporation CLA will receive an email, indicating that the signing is successful. The email contains the user name and initial password of **super administrato**r account.

#### 5. F&Qs

5.1 What Is the difference between the super administrator and system administrator in the Corporation Manager system?

There are two types of administrators in the Corporation Manager system of the openEuler community: super administrator and system administrator. After a Corporation CLA is created, the corporation email address used to sign the CLA will receive the account and initial password of the super system administrator. The administrator should log in to the system to change the initial password as soon as possible.

In corporate practice, managers or legal representatives typically execute the CLA. However, the oversight of developer contributions is not within their purview. Instead, system administrators assume this responsibility. Multiple system administrators can be appointed, each possessing equal authority to manage employee contributions.            

5.2 Does the openEuler community provide SLA commits for issue and CVE resolution?

In the openEuler open source community, all issues and CVE resolution are completed by contributors. Therefore, no business behavior is involved, and no SLA commits exist.

5.3 What are the email addresses that can be used to sign the Corporation CLA of openEuler?

Personal mailboxes such as 126.com, qq.com, and gmail.com cannot be used to sign the Corporation CLA. However, they can be used to sign the Individual CLA.

5.4 Does the legal representative have to sign the Corporation CLA?

The person who signs the Corporation CLA is the authorized representative of the corporation, not necessarily the legal representative.
