Hey everyone! I'm Ding Ziwei from KylinSoft, and also a maintainer at the [Compliance SIG](https://www.openeuler.org/en/sig/sig-detail/?name=sig-compliance)  (sig-compliance) in the OpenAtom openEuler community. Taking this opportunity, I'd like to share my story of getting involved with openEuler, the projects I've worked on, and how I've grown along the way.

# Getting Started with Open Source and openEuler

My open source journey began when I was a student. At that time, I often turned to famous open source communities to meet my needs as a developer. These communities were invaluable resources for learning and growing. As I transitioned into my professional career, my involvement in open source deepened. I began to see it as a platform for collaboration and innovation, not just a resource.

# Diving into openEuler at KylinSoft
## Becoming Part of the Community

At KylinSoft, our department collaborates closely with the openEuler community. This partnership allowed me to become a dedicated member of openEuler, actively contributing and building within the community. KylinSoft is deeply involved in various openEuler projects, including [NestOS](https://nestos.openeuler.org/) , PilotGo, and compliance initiatives. Our contributions help advance these projects and enhance our technical expertise and industry impact.

## My Role in the Compliance SIG

As a maintainer of the Compliance SIG, I focus on ensuring open source compliance. This involves developing governance methods, setting compliance criteria, and providing guidance to community members. One of the contributions I'm most proud of is writing the "Developer Open Source Compliance Practice Reference Manual ". I hope this manual helps more contributors meet compliance requirements and navigate their way in the open source community.


# Digging Deeper: My Personal Project on Community Documentation
## Understanding Developer Needs

Besides the routine work I've done in the compliance SIG, I also took a lot of time in working with the [Doc SIG](https://www.openeuler.org/en/sig/sig-detail/?name=doc)  (doc), during which time I realized how crucial documentation is for developers. To better understand their needs, I conducted a survey to gather insights into their perceptions of community documentation. This project aimed to pinpoint what developers find most important in documentation.

## Conducting the Survey

I divided the survey participants into two groups:

1. **Active Community Contributors**: Developers who frequently contribute to the community.  
2. **Less Involved Developers**: Developers who rarely participate in community activities.  

I distributed the questionnaire to colleagues, ensuring a balanced mix of both groups.

## Key Findings

The survey revealed that both groups prioritize the accuracy of community documents. However, active contributors value logical clarity more, while less involved developers emphasize the ease of participation, like having access to author information for further discussions.

## Suggestions for Documentation Improvement

Based on the survey results, I proposed the following suggestions:  
1. **Enhance Document Accuracy**: Remind document writers to thoroughly check and update content for new versions to avoid outdated information.  
2. **Improve Document Logic**: Standardize formatting and classify directories by version and feature to make navigation easier.  
3. **Facilitate Contributions**: Include authors' contact information in documents to help developers engage in further discussions and contributions.  
4. **Streamline Issue Handling**: Collaborate with SIG maintainers or committers to review specialized issues, reducing review time.  

# Growing Together with openEuler

My involvement in openEuler has not only been about contributing to the community but also about personal growth and development. The community has provided numerous opportunities for learning and collaboration, which have been instrumental in my journey.

## Inspiration from openEuler Developer Day

One of the most impactful experiences in my openEuler journey has been attending the [openEuler Developer Day](https://www.openeuler.org/zh/interaction/summit-list/devday2023/) (ODD). The event was a platform for sharing and exchanging technical and non-technical knowledge. It inspired me to clarify my ideas and motivated me to contribute more actively to the community. The open and supportive atmosphere of ODD, and the community as a whole, has been instrumental in my growth.

## Learning Through Collaboration

When I first started focusing on compliance, I acquired foundational knowledge from openEuler. Through active participation and communication within the community, I deepened my understanding and gained valuable insights. The collaborative spirit of openEuler has fostered continuous learning and improvement, making it an enriching environment for both personal and professional growth.

I want to express my gratitude to the openEuler community for providing such a fantastic platform and opportunity to connect with fellow developers. Sharing my story and learning from others has been incredibly rewarding.

If you're thinking about contributing, that's awesome! It really helps to spend a bit of time understanding the project's goals, the technology stack, and how the community works. Try to join discussions, follow the community guidelines, and keep learning along our journey in open source. It's great to communicate openly, test your code carefully, and be responsive to feedback. Every contribution is valuable.

I encourage everyone to share your thoughts or experiences in the comments below and in our community. Our feedback is invaluable to our community. Let's continue to share our stories, support each other, and bring more people into the world of open source!
