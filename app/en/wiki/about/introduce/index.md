# Introduction

OpenAtom openEuler (openEuler for short) is an open source project incubated and operated by the OpenAtom Foundation.

openEuler is an open source OS oriented to digital infrastructure that fits into any server, cloud computing, edge computing, and embedded deployment. This secure, stable, and easy-to-use open source OS is compatible with multiple computing architectures. openEuler suits operational technology (OT) applications and empowers the convergence of OT and information and communications technology (ICT).

The openEuler community works with global developers to build an open, diversified, and architecture-inclusive software ecosystem. It covers all scenarios of digital facilities, and empowers enterprises to develop their hardware and software as well as application ecosystems.
