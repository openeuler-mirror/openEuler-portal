  synopsis: 'Overview',
  introduction: 'Features',
  introductionDesc:
    'openEuler Intelligence is a comprehensive large language model (LLM) platform built on openEuler. It offers fundamental capabilities for integrating with OpenAI APIs and creating custom local knowledge bases. The platform also enables users to register semantic interfaces and Model Context Protocol (MCP) services, and develop Agent-based applications and workflows. Available in both web and client versions, it delivers exceptional convenience for developers and enterprises alike.',
